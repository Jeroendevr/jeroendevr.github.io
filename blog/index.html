  <p>As I have been using SPYDER as one of my main IDE for programming in Python, I wanted to install the beta version however I have challenged myself to download and install this though PIP instead of conda.
Official <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">documentation</a> on installing development builds.</p>
<h1>Prerequisite</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="../blog/python-on-a-mac">Python installation</a></li>
<li><a href="../blog/virtual-enviroment">VirtualEnv package</a></li>
<li>GIT</li>
</ul>
<h1>Launch from console</h1>
<p>To launch Spyder you have to <code>cd</code> to you SPYDER installation and <code>python bootstrap.py</code> It would be better to launch a application u use often directly from terminal. 
This can be done by defining a function in your terminal preference file. In my case my shell is zsh as it is default since macOS Catalina. 
<code>open ~/.zshrc</code> and define your own function within this preference file.</p>
<p>In my case I have defined a function <em>spyder</em> as follows</p>
<pre><code>spyder() {

    cd /Users/jeroendevries/Programming/env_spyder/spyder

    git pull https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder.git

    python3 bootstrap.py
</code></pre>

  <p>macOS Catalina</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> can be installed using different ways on a Mac. A how to install is described on the python website. However I like no nonsens and clean installation. So I use a package manager to install all sorts of tools.</p>
<h2>HomeBrew</h2>
<p>Install <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> a package manager for Mac.</p>
<h2>Command Line Tools</h2>
<p>Next to home-brew you need the xcode command tools. You can install those typing <code>xcode-select --install</code> in the terminal.</p>
<p>If receiving the following  <em>already installed message </em></p>
<blockquote><p>xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates[1]
Try
<code>softwareupdate --install -a</code> to install all available updates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you where not able to install Python 3.x try reinstall HomeBrew see this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46459152/cant-chown-usr-local-for-homebrew-in-mac-os-x-10-13-high-sierra">Question</a></p>

  <h1>The blog</h1>
<p>So finally I have chosen to put up my blog. That is not special in itself but I have searched and tried a lot of platforms without actually using the platform. I have tried Wordpress hosted and . This platform is created by a static website generator called Lektor. It is quite easy to set up, if you know your way with the terminal app.</p>
<h2>Qt</h2>
<p>My current field of interest is the Qt framework. It is a GraphicalUserInterface similar to Tkinter only it seems that some things are easier to create within this framework. Right now I have followed some tutorials online some suggested by the 
Python [PyQt wiki].</p>
<h2>Further away</h2>
<p>Just now I find it rather difficult to think what I want to do next. Off course I have idea’s but those are quite big and don’t know where to start. For example recreating a application we use at work to make it a little more modern. Besides creating an application I tried to set up a webserver, building stuff with an Arduino and a Raspberry pi. But I cannot find a thing that really interest me to keep on working. I get distracted too many times by other (in my opinion) great ideas.</p>
<h2>Good start</h2>
<p>While starting this blog finally can bring me some direction in what I want to do and accomplish while I write my thoughts down and sharing my experience along the way.</p>
