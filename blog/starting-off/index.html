  <h1>The blog</h1>
<p>So finally I have chosen to put up my blog. That is not special in itself but I have searched and tried a lot of platforms without actually using the platform. I have tried Wordpress hosted and . This platform is created by a static website generator called Lektor. It is quite easy to set up, if you know your way with the terminal app.</p>
<h2>Qt</h2>
<p>My current field of interest is the Qt framework. It is a GraphicalUserInterface similar to Tkinter only it seems that some things are easier to create within this framework. Right now I have followed some tutorials online some suggested by the 
Python [PyQt wiki].</p>
<h2>Further away</h2>
<p>Just now I find it rather difficult to think what I want to do next. Off course I have idea’s but those are quite big and don’t know where to start. For example recreating a application we use at work to make it a little more modern. Besides creating an application I tried to set up a webserver, building stuff with an Arduino and a Raspberry pi. But I cannot find a thing that really interest me to keep on working. I get distracted too many times by other (in my opinion) great ideas.</p>
<h2>Good start</h2>
<p>While starting this blog finally can bring me some direction in what I want to do and accomplish while I write my thoughts down and sharing my experience along the way.</p>
