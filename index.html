  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this website is to share my IT / Programming related journey,  of the issues, solutions and resources I have come across developing myself. 
In many cases it seems I am the only one experiencing a certain problem. The solutions lies in multiple sub solutions and sometimes even though the problem is solved. I still don’t understand <em>why</em>the solution has worked out. On this website I hope to create a layered description of the path I needed to take to make a certain problem solved. Not a step by step tutorial but a layered approach so those who want to understand why can read the why.</p>
<p>This all is at least my goal, if one of the steps is missing clearance or have any suggestion be welcome to dm me at my GitHub account where this website is hosted.</p>
